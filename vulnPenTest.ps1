<#Certainly! While some security tools are more commonly associated with Bash or other Unix-like environments, 
there are PowerShell equivalents or ways to achieve similar results in a Windows environment. 
Here's an attempt to provide PowerShell examples:


Remember, these examples assume that the necessary tools and scripts are available in the specified paths. 
Always check the documentation for each tool to ensure proper usage and adapt the examples based on your 
specific environment and requirements. Additionally, ensure that you have proper authorization before 
conducting any penetration testing.#>
<#Vulnerability Scanning:

    Nessus:
        Nessus has a web interface, but you can automate scans using its API with PowerShell.
    Example:
    powershell#>

# Sample PowerShell script for Nessus API scan
$NessusServer = "https://nessus-server:8834"
$ApiKey = "your_api_key"
$ScanPolicy = "Internal Network Scan"
$Target = "target_IP"

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$NessusServer/scans" -Method Post -Headers @{ "X-API-Token" = $ApiKey } -Body @{
    scan_profile = $ScanPolicy
    targets = $Target
} -ContentType 'application/json'

<#OpenVAS (Greenbone Security Assistant):
    OpenVAS/Greenbone has a web interface, but automation can be done with omp (OpenVAS Management Protocol).
Example:
powershell#>

    # Sample PowerShell script for OpenVAS
    $Username = "your_username"
    $Password = "your_password"
    $Host = "openvas-host"
    $Port = "9390"
    $OutputFile = "output_file.xml"

    & "omp.exe" -u $Username -w $Password -h $Host -p $Port --xml=$OutputFile --xml-file-version=1.0

<#Penetration Testing:
    Metasploit:
        Metasploit is written in Ruby, so it's not native PowerShell. However, you can still use PowerShell to execute Metasploit commands.
    Example:
    powershell#>

# Sample PowerShell script to interact with Metasploit
$MetasploitPath = "C:\Metasploit\framework"
$MetasploitCommand = "msfconsole"

Start-Process -FilePath "cmd.exe" -ArgumentList "/c cd $MetasploitPath && $MetasploitCommand"

<#Nmap:
    Nmap is a native Windows tool and can be used directly in PowerShell.
Example:
powershell#>

# Sample PowerShell script for Nmap
$Target = "target_IP"

& "nmap.exe" $Target

<#PowerShell Empire:
    PowerShell Empire is native to PowerShell.
Example:
powershell#>

    # Launch PowerShell Empire
    Import-Module .\Empire.psd1
    Start-Empire
