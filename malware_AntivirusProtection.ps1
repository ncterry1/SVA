<#Checking for malware and antivirus protection on a Windows machine can be done using PowerShell, 
a scripting language built into Windows. Here's a simple PowerShell script that you can use to retrieve 
information about installed antivirus products:
Save this script with a .ps1 extension (e.g., CheckAntivirus.ps1) and then run it using PowerShell. 
The script uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to query information from the Security Center 
about installed antivirus products.

Here's how to run the script:

    Open PowerShell on the Windows machine (you might need to run PowerShell as an administrator for some systems).
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the cd command.
    Run the script by entering .\CheckAntivirus.ps1 and pressing Enter.

The script will then display information about the installed antivirus products on the system.

Keep in mind that the script relies on the Security Center (available on Windows Security Center-enabled systems) 
to provide information about antivirus products. Some antivirus products may not register with the Security Center, 
so this script might not capture all installed antivirus software. Additionally, newer Windows versions may use 
different mechanisms for antivirus detection and reporting. Adjustments to the script may be necessary based on the 
specific environment and requirements.#>
#powershell

# Get a list of installed antivirus products on the system
$antivirusProducts = Get-WmiObject -Namespace "Root\SecurityCenter2" -Class AntiVirusProduct

# Check if any antivirus products are installed
if ($antivirusProducts) {
    Write-Host "Antivirus Products:"
    
    # Display information about each installed antivirus product
    foreach ($product in $antivirusProducts) {
        Write-Host "  - $($product.displayName)"
        Write-Host "    Version: $($product.displayVersion)"
        Write-Host "    State: $($product.productState)"
        Write-Host ""
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "No antivirus products found on the system."
}
