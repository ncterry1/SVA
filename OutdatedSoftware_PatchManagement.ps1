Checking for outdated software and patch management on a Windows machine can be done using various methods. 
One commonly used approach is to utilize PowerShell, a powerful scripting language available on Windows. 
Below is a simple PowerShell script that checks for installed Windows updates and their status:

Save this script with a .ps1 extension (e.g., CheckUpdates.ps1) and execute it using PowerShell.

This script retrieves a list of installed updates, filters them to include only updates (excluding things like security patches), 
and displays relevant information such as update name, HotFix ID, and installation date. It also checks if there is a pending reboot,
which is often required after certain updates.

Please note that the effectiveness of this script may depend on the specific configuration and update settings on the Windows machine. 
Additionally, running PowerShell scripts may require appropriate permissions, and execution policies may need to be adjusted if 
they are restricted on the system. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions and are following security best practices 
when executing scripts on a system.

#powershell

# Get a list of installed updates
$installedUpdates = Get-HotFix

# Filter updates to include only those classified as 'Update'
$softwareUpdates = $installedUpdates | Where-Object {$_.Description -eq 'Update'}

# Display the results
foreach ($update in $softwareUpdates) {
    Write-Output "Update Name: $($update.Description)"
    Write-Output "HotFix ID: $($update.HotFixID)"
    Write-Output "Installed On: $($update.InstalledOn)"
    Write-Output "----------------------------------------"
}

# Check for pending reboots
$pendingReboots = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object -ExpandProperty RebootPending

if ($pendingReboots -eq $true) {
    Write-Output "Pending Reboot: Yes"
} else {
    Write-Output "Pending Reboot: No"
}
