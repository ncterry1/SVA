#Web application security testing often involves a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing. 
#For automated scanning, one popular tool is OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy). ZAP is an open-source security 
#testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. Below is an example of how you might use ZAP
#in a script on a Windows machine.

#Please note that using security testing tools on web applications you do not own or have permission to test 
#is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any web application.

#Here's a basic example script using OWASP ZAP on Windows:

    #Download and Install ZAP:
    #Download the latest version of OWASP ZAP from the official website (https://www.zaproxy.org/download/), 
#and follow the installation instructions.

   # Create a ZAP Script:
   # Create a script file, e.g., zap_scan_script.py, with the following content:

    python

import subprocess
import time

# Path to ZAP executable
zap_path = r'C:\Path\To\ZAP\zap.bat'

# URL of the target web application
target_url = 'http://example.com'

# Start ZAP in daemon mode
subprocess.Popen([zap_path, '-daemon'])

# Give ZAP time to start
time.sleep(10)

# Execute the ZAP Spider to crawl the target
subprocess.Popen([zap_path, '-cmd', '-quickurl', target_url, '-quickout', 'spider'])

# Give ZAP time to complete the spidering
time.sleep(60)

# Execute the ZAP Active Scan to identify vulnerabilities
subprocess.Popen([zap_path, '-cmd', '-quickurl', target_url, '-quickout', 'activeScan'])

# Give ZAP time to complete the active scan
time.sleep(120)

# Shutdown ZAP
subprocess.Popen([zap_path, '-cmd', 'SHUTDOWN'])

print("ZAP scanning completed.")

#Update the zap_path variable with the correct path to your ZAP executable, and set the target_url 
#variable to the URL of the web application you want to test.

#Run the ZAP Script:
#Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run the script:

bash

    python zap_scan_script.py

    #This script starts ZAP in daemon mode, performs spidering to discover the structure of the web 
#application, and then conducts an active scan to identify potential vulnerabilities.

#Remember, this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the script based on the specific requirements 
#of your web application and testing goals. Additionally, always ensure that you have proper authorization to 
#perform security testing on any web application.
